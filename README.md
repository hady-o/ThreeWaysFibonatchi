# ThreeWaysFibonatchi
This program computes the piecewise recurrence relation using three different methods: recurrence relation, iteration, and dynamic programming.
## Recurrence Relation
F(n) = F(n-3) + F(n -2) where F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1, and F(2) = 2.
## Implementation Details
### Recurrence Relation
This method has an exponential time complexity of O(2^n).
### Iteration
The iteration method computes the recurrence relation using a loop. This method has a linear time complexity of O(n) and constant space complextt O(1).
### Dynamic Programming
The dynamic programming method computes recurrence relation using a memoization technique to store the previously computed Fibonacci numbers. This method has a linear time complexity of O(n) but use more memory.
